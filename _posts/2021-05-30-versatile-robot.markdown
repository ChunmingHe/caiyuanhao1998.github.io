We build a mobile trash sorting robot loaded with two Kinova Gen3 arms that can autonomously classify and grasp recyclable, non-recyclable and hazardous waste, based on ROS system. In addition, it can shake the bottle to judge if there is water in it with tactile information,  and then screw the cap to pour out water according to the judgement.
